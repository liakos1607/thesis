Construction of automatic system avoiding obstacles and mapping space with machine learning methods in robotic vehicles
The purpose of this thesis is mapping an indoor environment and avoiding obstacles with the help of the robot pioneer 3dx.
Sonar and other sensors contributed to the mapping procedure algorithms of machine learning used to map unexplored areas. 
Î¤he estimation of the pose of the robot was completed without camera but with the help of sensors and the algorithm of odometry
which took information from the position sensors of the robot.
Also for better simulation of the real world noise was added to ultrasonic sensors and position sensors which is reduced with filter EKF with satisfying results.
